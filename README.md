To play this game, you can install an extension called 'Live Server' to VS Code.
Open the 'index.html' file in Live Server. Open the console in developer tools and create a new game, e.g. `const myFirstGame = new Game(["Emma","Jenna","Raj],9)` to test the players on finding multiples of 9.
To play a turn, you can enter `myFirstGame.play(10)` for example.
